<p>Not at all. We have ensured that the basic data and file formatting paradigm is general enough that it can be extended to any other scientific domain so long as each experiment involves N identical measurements of S values. Our data and file format can easily be extended to neutron science, nuclear sciences, etc. Note that one of the major strengths of pycroscopy is its ability to handle large, multi-dimensional / hyper spectral data like no other software can. Furthermore, some of our scientific analysis algorithms such as curve-fitting for spectra, image denoising can easily find applications in scientific domains beyond imaging and microscopy.</p>

We think that pycroscopy is complementary to these  other softwares and packages. Pycroscopy was built for a completely different purpose and with a unique philosophy. Pycroscopy solves some truly challenging problems that none of the other packages do - It can handle arbitrarily large datasets (Gigabytes / Terabytes / or even larger) with arbitrary dimensionality (any combination of dimensionality in position and spectral space. We have had absolutely no problem dealing with datasets with more than 9 unique dimensions - see <a class="reference external" href="https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/dev_tutorials/plot_tutorial_03_multidimensional_data.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-dev-tutorials-plot-tutorial-03-multidimensional-data-py">Band Excitation Polarization Switching + First Order Reversal Curve probing</a>). In addition, Pycroscopy takes a data centric approach aimed towards open science wherein all the data starting from the raw measurement from the instrument, all the way to the final data that is plotted in the resulting scientific publication, are contained in the same file. The processing steps applied to the data are completely transparent and traceable. Furthermore, pycroscopy was developed from the ground up to run on laptops while aiming towards compatibility with supercomputers. <a class="reference external" href="http://gxsm.sourceforge.net">GXSM</a> is another software package that focuses more on the data acquistion than advanced data analysis</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Why is pycroscopy written in python and not C / Fortran / Julia?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-pycroscopy-written-in-python-and-not-c-fortran-julia" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the main objectives of pycroscopy is to lower the barrier to advanced data analytics for domain scientists such as material scientists. A C / Fortran version of pycroscopy would certainly have been more efficient than the current python code-base. However, the learning curve for writing efficient C code is far steeper compared to python / Julia / Matlab for the average domain scientist. Focusing on science is a big enough job for domain scientists and we want to make it as easy as possible to adopt pycroscopy even for those who are novices at programming. Furthermore, our code makes heavy use of highly efficient numerical and scientific libraries such as Numpy and Scipy that are comparable in speed to C so we do not expect our code to be substantially slower than C / Fortran. Julia is a (relatively) new language similar to python that promises to be as fast as C and as easy as python and purpose-built for efficient computing. However, as of this writing, Julia unfortunately still does not have open-source package ecosystem that is as large or diverse (think of the many packages necessary to read obscure proprietary microscopy file formats as an example) as python. Furthermore, python’s unchallenged leadership in the data analytics / deep learning field have only validated it as the language of choice. These are among the main reasons pycroscopy is written in python.</p>

<p>Not at all. One of the tenets of pycroscopy is lowering the barrier for scientists and researchers. To this end, we have developed <a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/">several notebooks</a> that make data visualization, discovery, and analysis interactive. You should have absolutely no trouble in using these notebooks even if you do not know programming. That being said, you would be able to make the fullest use of pycroscopy if you knew basic programming in python.</p>

<p>You can use practically any laptop / desktop / virtual machine running Windows / Mac OS / Linux. Pycroscopy is not tested on 32 bit operating systems (very unlikely that your computer is a 32 bit system. Even your phone uses a 64 bit operating system).</p>

<p>Traditional graphical interfaces are rather time consuming to develop. Instead, we provide jupyter widgets to interact with data wherever possible. Here are some great examples that use jupyter widgets to simplify interaction with the data:</p>

<p>Actually, all data processing / analysis algorithms we have written in pycroscopy can use every single core on your CPU. Given N CPU cores, you should notice a nearly N-fold speed up in your computation. By default, we set aside 2 cores for the operating system and other user applications such as an internet browser, Microsoft Word, etc.</p>

<p>We consider data recorded for all combinations of 2 or more variables as multi-dimensional datasets. For example, if a single value of current is recorded as a function of driving / excitation bias or voltage having B values, the dataset is said to be 1 dimensional and the dimension would be - bias. If the bias is cycled C times, the data is said to be two dimensional. If the bias is varied over B values over C cycles at X columns and Y rows in a 2D grid of positions, the resultant dataset would have 4 dimensions (Y, X, C, B). As a different example, let us suppose that the petal width, length, and weight were measured for F different kinds of flowers. This would result in a 1 dimensional dataset with the kind of flower being the sole dimension. Such a dataset is not a 3 dimensional dataset because the petal width, length, and weight are only different features for each measurement. A quantity is not being measured for all combinations of petal width, length, and weight to make this dataset 3 dimensional.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Why not use established file formats from other domains?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-use-established-file-formats-from-other-domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is true that we really don’t want yet another format in our lives. We wanted to adopt a file format that is already widely accepted in supercomputing, scientific research, can be accessed from any programming language. We chose HDF5 since it suits our needs perfectly. We found that existing data formats in science such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nexusformat.org">Nexus data format</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> were designed for narrow scientific purposes and we did not want to shoehorn our data structure into those formats. Furthermore, despite being some of the more popular scientific data formats, it is not immidiately straightforward to read those files on every computer using any programming language. For example - the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/">Anaconda</a> python distribution does not come with any packages for reading these file formats. Moreover, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/adios/">Adios</a>, Nexus, NetCDF, and even <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html">Matlab’s .mat</a> files are actually (now) just custom flavors of HDF5 files thereby unanimously validating our decision to choose HDF5 as our file format. Unlike Nexus, NetCDF, Matlab’s .mat files, pycroscopy does not impose any strict restrictions or requirements on the HDF5 file structure. Instead, implementing the pycroscopy data format only increases the functionality of the very same datasets in pycroscopy.</p>

<p>Pycroscopy has numerous translators that extract the data and metadata (e.g. - instrument / imaging parameters) from some popular file formats and store the information in HDF5 files. You can find a list of available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/tree/master/pycroscopy/io/translators">translators here</a>.</p>

<p>Chances are that there is a (or multiple) python package out there already that reads the data from your file into python. All you will need to do is to write the data and metadata to HDF5 files by writing your own Translator. We have <a class="reference external" href="https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/auto_examples/index.html#developer-tutorials">examples available here</a>.</p>

<p>Not really. Python is far easier to learn than many languages. If you know Matlab, Julia, C++, Fortran or any other programming language. You should not have a hard time reading our code or contributing to the codebase.</p>
<p>You can still contribute your code.</p>

<p>Your contributions are very valuable to the microscopy, imaging, and scientific community at large. You can help even if you DON’T know how to program!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can spread the word - tell anyone who you think may benefit from using pycroscopy.</li>
<li>Tell us what you think of our documentation or share your own.</li>
<li>Let us know what you would like to see in pycroscopy.</li>

<p>Chances are that you are far better at python than you might think! Interesting tidbit - The (first version of the) first module of pycroscopy was written less than a week after we learnt how to write code in python. We weren’t great programmers when we began but we would like to think that we have gotten a lot better since then.</p>
<p>You can contribute in numerous ways including but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Writing translators to convert data from proprietary formats to the pycroscopy format - We are missing some for Park Systems, Bruker, Anasys AFMs and certain electron microscopy formats.</li>
<li>Writing image processing, signal processing code, functional fitting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current efforts are focussed on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy/blob/master/ToDo.rst#v-1-0-goals">making pycroscopy substantially more robust and user-friendly</a>. We could certainly use your help there too. Send us an email at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pycroscopy&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">pycroscopy<span>&#64;</span>gmail<span>&#46;</span>com</a> or a message on our <a class="reference external" href="https://pycroscopy.slack.com/">slack group</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to thank you and several others who have offered their code. We are more than happy to add your code to this project. Just as we strive to ensure that you get the best possible software from us, we ask that you do the same for others. We do NOT ask that your code be as efficient as possible. Instead, we have some simpler and easier requests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Encapsulate indpendent sections of your code into functions that can be used individually if required.</li>
<li>Ensure that your code (functions) is well documented (numpy format) - expected inputs and outputs, purpose of functions</li>
<li>Ensure that your code works in python 2.7 and python 3.5 (ideally using packages that are easy to install on Windows, Mac, and Linux)</li>
<li>Provide a few examples on how one might use your code</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at our code in our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycroscopy/pycroscopy">GitHub project</a> to get an idea of how we organize, document, and submit our code.</p>
